## Hi there! 👋

I'm **Fernando H. Gavezzotti**, a software developer with a strong interest in programming languages, databases, and high-quality document writing and typesetting. I care deeply about clarity, simplicity, and attention to detail in everything I build.

## About Me

I'm currently based in Milan, Italy. I enjoy programming as a way to turn complex ideas into solutions that are easy to understand and use. I put a lot of thought into structure, naming, and documentation, because I believe good software should explain itself as much as possible.

Alongside programming and databases, I have a strong interest in typesetting and technical writing. Tools like LaTeX and Typst allow me to express ideas with precision and care, and they reflect the same mindset I bring to code: correctness, readability, and attention to detail.

> Fun fact: Since `fexh` was already taken on GitHub, I added `10` to it, that in binary represents the number 2 (and yes, I’m still annoyed about it).
